### Secure API Gateway
- The Secure API Gateway (SAPI-G) is an Open Source project initiated by [ForgeRock](https://www.forgerock.com/).
- The SAPI-G uses [ForgeRock's Identity Platform](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud) and [Identity Gateway](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway) to provide Identity and Access Management that allows rapid development of secure APIs.
- Built to protect APIs to [Financial API (FAPI)](https://openid.net/wg/fapi/) standard

## v1.0.0 is here

- Financial-grade API (FAPI) security
- Built to allow FAPI grade protection of custome APIs - provide revenue generating APIs alongside the mandatory OB/PSD2 APIs
- A complete set of protected UK Open Banking API account and payment endpoints
- A 'test facility' bank - allows an Open Banking Test facility to be created in hours not months
